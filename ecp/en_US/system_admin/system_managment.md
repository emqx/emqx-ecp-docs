# System Settings

The system settings in ECP constitute a crucial module within the platform, comprising three distinct sub-modules: resource allocation, universal settings, and page configuration:



1. In **[Resource Settings](./resource_config.md)**, system admins can configure the Kubernetes connection, image versions, and storage class, as well as customize the specifications for EMQX clusters and edge services, like Neuron and eKuiper. 
2. In **[General Settings](./general_config.md)**, system admins can configure the email server, root URL for accessing ECP, user invite method, log settings, monitoring and alarm configurations, and system language settings.  
3. ECP also supports customizing the landing page for your ECP platform, navigate to **System Settings** -> **[Page Settings](./customized_layout.md)**, where you can customize the logo, system name, and login page.
