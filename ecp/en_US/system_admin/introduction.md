# Organizations and Projects

ECP leverages organizations and projects for streamlined resource management. Admins create organizations, assigning users and resources with controlled permissions. Organization admins and project admins within each organization can create projects, assign users, and define precise permissions and restrictions. This ensures centralized management and resource optimization. 

This chapter introduces how to create and manage organizations and projects in ECP and some other system-level configuration items.
